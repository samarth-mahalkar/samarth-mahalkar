# Hi there 👋

## About Me
I'm a developer who loves building cool projects, learning new tools, and experimenting with ideas.  
I enjoy working with code, exploring random files, and turning messy ideas into real projects.

## 🚀 My Projects
- **Project One** — A cool tool that does amazing things.  
- **Project Two** — Something I'm experimenting with using a random file.  
- **Project Three** — More coming soon!

## 📂 Random File Highlight
I like using random files as inspiration.  
Here’s something pulled from a file I'm playing with:
